  <h4 class='h4 ml1 mr1'>The Course Catalog For Lakehead University Students</h4>

  <p class='ml1 mr1'>Thundr was made by a Lakehead undergrad student named Tim after making note of how difficult it is to plan out a schedule using the built in tools. The initial idea was to create a course scheduling tool that allowed students to map out their schedule before registering for courses.</p>
  <p class='ml1 mr1'>I hope that this small tool will serve useful tool to students and assist in planning schedules and registering for courses.</p>
  <p class='ml1 mr1'>In the future, I'd like to implement the actual course scheduling feature, including saving schedules, viewing friends' courses, and more.</p>
  <p class='ml1 mr1'>While I was working on this project, I quickly realized that I hadn't done much work in actual website design. I mentioned my idea for this project to my good friend Rob who told me about <a href='http://qcumber.ca/'>Qcumber</a>, a course catalog for students at Queen's University. I wish to apologize to and thank <a href='https://twitter.com/QuixoticChris'>Chris</a> from <a href='http://qcumber.ca/'>Qcumber</a> for stealing his layout and design ideas. :)</p>
  <p class='ml1 mr1'>Thundr is open-source! Check it out at <%= render 'layouts/github_link' %></p>
